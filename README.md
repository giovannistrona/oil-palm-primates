# oil-palm-primates
Python and R code associated to the paper "Small room for compromise between oil palm 
cultivation and primate conservation in Africa". The code permits the full replication 
of all the analyses in the paper, as well as the reproduction of all figures 
(including the supplementary one). Analyses and map plotting are performed by the Python
script "script_oil_palm_primates.py", while the R code in "make_plots.R" permit the reproduction
of the other graphs. Note that the R code is called by the Python script, so the execution of 
the latter is enough for complete analysis replication.

All the raw input files necessary to run the analyses can be downloaded from Zenodo at:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200255

It is important that all the input files (which are provided in a single compressed zipped archive 
named INPUT_DATA.zip) are left in their relative position within their folder once this is unzipped,
and that both "script_oil_palm_primates.py" and "make_plots.R" are copied in that same folder.
At that point, running (from within the folder) the "script_oil_palm_primates.py" will perform
all the analyses and generate all the output files. 

All the expected output can be downloaded from Zenodo at: 
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200265.
